## Introduction

As a developer working with databases day in day out, you must sometimes ask yourself how does a database work?
- What format is data saved in? (in memory and on disk)
- When does it move from memory to disk?
- Why can there only be one primary key per table?
- How does rolling back a transaction work?
- How are indexes formatted?
- When and how does a full table scan happen?
- What format is a prepared statement saved in?

To figure things out, I’m writing a database from scratch. It’s modeled off sqlite because it is designed to be small with fewer features than MySQL or PostgreSQL, so I have a better hope of understanding it. The entire database is stored in a single file!

## Architecture
[![Architecture](images/arch1.gif)](https://github.com/kwahome/simple-db/blob/master/images/arch1.gif)

A query goes through a chain of components in order to retrieve or modify data. The *front-end* consists of the:

- tokenizer
- parser
- code generator

The input to the front-end is a SQL query. the output is sqlite virtual machine bytecode (essentially a compiled program that can operate on the database).

The *back-end* consists of the:

- virtual machine
- B-tree
- pager
- os interface

The *virtual machine* takes bytecode generated by the front-end as instructions. It can then perform operations on one or more tables or indexes, each of which is stored in a data structure called a B-tree. The VM is essentially a big switch statement on the type the bytecode instruction.

Each *B-tree* consists of many nodes. Each node is one page in length. The B-tree can retrieve a page from disk or save it back to disk by issuing commands to the pager.

The *pager* receives commands to read or write pages of data. It is responsible for reading/writing at appropriate offsets in the database file. It also keeps a cache of recently-accessed pages in memory, and determines when those pages need to be written back to disk.

The *os interface* is the layer that differs depending on which operating system sqlite was compiled for. In this tutorial, I’m not going to support multiple platforms.
